🐾 SkyTails — UX Redesign Prototype (Version 2)

Overview

This repository contains Version 2 of the SkyTails website and product experience redesign.
The goal of this prototype is to rethink the current onboarding and engagement flow to improve:
	•	🚀 Acquisition – Faster signup with reduced friction
	•	💡 Engagement – Dashboard-first experience focused on pets
	•	📈 Revenue – Progressive onboarding that introduces financial setup at the right moment

This version draws inspiration from modern product storytelling patterns (similar to leading pet-focused and fintech platforms) while preserving the core SkyTails mission of helping pet parents build a better financial future.

Key challenges identified:
	•	Long onboarding forms
	•	Financial-first messaging instead of pet-first storytelling
	•	Limited early value demonstration before signup
	•	Low emotional engagement during initial flows
